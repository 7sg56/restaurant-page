# Honey Website

This project is a modern website concept for a hypothetical honey-based shop. Designed with creativity and functionality in mind, the goal is to craft a sleek, responsive, and visually captivating interface. While the focus is on a honey-themed restaurant or food-product pages, the design could inspire other types of culinary or product-based sites.
